In his brand-new special, RUGGED, Ali trades the past gripping tales of his Domino Effect series (40+ million views on YouTube!) for a hilarious deep dive into his current home life, where his DIY attempts go horribly wrong.  From botched repairs and general home maintenance failures, to a family that has zero faith in his handyman skills, Ali delivers his signature blend of sharp wit and real-life storytelling.

      "ALI SIDDIQ: RUGGED [Full Stand Up Comedy Special],\"Ali Siddiq is many things—a master storyteller, a comedy powerhouse—but a handyman?  Not even close. In his brand-new special, RUGGED, Ali trades the past gripping tales of his Domino Effect series (40+ million views on YouTube!) for a hilarious deep dive into his current home life, where his DIY attempts go horribly wrong.  From botched repairs and general home maintenance failures, to a family that has zero faith in his handyman skills, Ali delivers his signature blend of sharp wit and real-life storytelling. You’re going to laugh, cringe, and feel a little better about your own abilities. \n",

      "ALI SIDDIQ: RUGGED [Full Stand Up Comedy Special],\"Ali Siddiq is many things—a master storyteller, a comedy powerhouse—but a handyman?  Not even close. In his brand-new special, RUGGED, Ali trades the past gripping tales of his Domino Effect series (40+ million views on YouTube!) for a hilarious deep dive into his current home life, where his DIY attempts go horribly wrong.  From botched repairs and general home maintenance failures, to a family that has zero faith in his handyman skills, Ali delivers his signature blend of sharp wit and real-life storytelling. You’re going to laugh, cringe, and feel a little better about your own abilities. \n",

Now, on our previous trips to East Asia, we definitely noticed the prevalence of 7-Elevens pretty much everywhere - and not only were we surprised by how widespread and popular they were - we quickly realized, they had a lot of pretty awesome stuff we don’t have in the states - like, baos, teas, sandos, noodles, iced coffees, unique chip flavors, pancake sandwiches, corn ice cream - and more!! And once we returned - I started to notice how many people online were also going to international 7-Elevens and doing snack hauls - and I realized - this is a convenience store movement!! \n",

      "\"Vance Boelter captured after manhunt in murders of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman, her husband\",\"(AP) The man suspected of killing a Minnesota lawmaker and wounding another has been taken into custody, two law enforcement officials said, bringing an end to a nearly two-day search that put the state on edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vance Boelter was arrested Sunday evening. The arrest was confirmed to The Associated Press by law enforcement officials were who were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the ongoing investigation and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity. Former Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were killed in their Brooklyn Park home early Saturday in the northern Minneapolis suburbs. Sen. John Hoffman, also a Democrat, and his wife, Yvette, were injured at their Champlin home, about 9 miles (about 15 kilometers) away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boelter was captured in Minnesota, though officials didn’t immediately say where.\n",
      "\n",
      "A criminal complaint unsealed Sunday night says Boelter faces two counts of second-degree murder and two counts of attempted second-degree murder in the deaths of the Hortmans and the wounding of Hoffman and his wife.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Hoffmans were attacked first at their home in Champin early Saturday. After police in nearby Brooklyn Park learned of that shooting, they sent patrol officers to check on the Hortmans’ home.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complaint says the Brooklyn Park police officers arrived just in time to see Boelter shoot Mark Hortman through the open door of the home. It says they exchanged gunfire with Boelter, who fled inside the home before escaping the scene.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier Sunday Drew Evans, superintendent of the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, said authorities found a car very early Sunday they believed Boelter was using, a few miles from his home in Green Isle, in the farm country about an hour west of Minneapolis. He also said they found evidence in the car that was relevant to the investigation, but did not provide details.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities named Boelter, 57, as a suspect, saying he wore a mask as he posed as a police officer, even allegedly altering a vehicle to make it look like a police car.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evens confirmed that investigators found a cowboy hat near the vehicle and believe it belonged to Boelter. The superintendent also said authorities interviewed Boelter’s wife and other family members in connection with Saturday’s shootings. He said they were cooperative and were not in custody.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FBI had issued a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction. They circulated a photo taken Saturday of Boelter wearing a tan cowboy hat and asked the public to report sightings.\n",
      "\n",
      "More than 100 law enforcement officers including SWAT teams were searching the area, including nearby homes, Evans said. He also said they had received more than 400 tips from the public.\n",
      "\n",
      "The earlier search happened in rural Sibley County, roughly 50 miles (80 kilometers) southwest of Minneapolis, where Boelter had a home with his wife and five children. Residents in the area received an emergency alert about the located vehicle that warned them to lock their doors and cars.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shootings come as political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions. Lawmakers said they were disturbed by the attacks as Twin Cities residents mourned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brightly colored flowers and small American flags were placed Sunday on the gray marbled stone of the Minnesota State Capitol along with a photo of the Hortmans. People scrawled messages on small notes including, “You were our leader through the hardest of times. Rest in Power.”\n",

The film also stars Edi Gathegi (“For All Mankind”), Anthony Carrigan (“Barry,” “Gotham”), Nathan Fillion (the “Guardians of the Galaxy” films, “The Suicide Squad”), Isabela Merced (“Alien Romulus”), Skyler Gisondo (“Licorice Pizza,” “Booksmart”), Sara Sampaio (“At Midnight”), María Gabriela de Faría (“The Moodys”), Wendell Pierce (“Selma,” “Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan”), Alan Tudyk (“Andor”), Pruitt Taylor Vince (“Bird Box”) and Neva Howell (“Greedy People”).\n",

      "It doesn’t really need an explanation—you know exactly what Kehlani means when she sings. Without sugarcoating or softening a word, the Bay Area-born two-time GRAMMY® Award-nominated multiplatinum songstress will drop a hard truth in one breath and flip a middle finger in the next. She may extend a seductive invitation or an empathetic plea before leaving you in your thoughts and feelings. Either way, she finds a way to consistently relate without filter. With each move, she strengthens this connection to listeners everywhere.  Kehlani’s 2015 breakout mixtape You Should Be Here received a 2016 GRAMMY® Award nod in the category of “Best Urban Contemporary Album.” On its heels, her 2017 full-length debut SweetSexySavage bowed at #3 on the Billboard Top 200 and eventually went gold. Between selling out dates on the SweetSexySavage Tour, the record closed out the year on Pitchfork’s “The 50 Best Albums of 2017” and Rolling Stone’s “20 Best R&B Albums of 2017.” \n",
      "\n",
      "Along the way, she contributed to Suicide Squad: The Album and The Fate of the Furious: The Album and guested on Cardi B’s double-platinum “Ring,” Kyle’s platinum “PLAYINWITME,” and Justin Bieber’s “Get Me,” to name a few. By 2020, she picked up three gold solo singles—\"\"You Should Be Here,” “Honey,” and “Distraction,” for which she received her second GRAMMY® nomination for Best R&B performance. In addition, four platinum singles—“Gangsta,” “The Way” [feat. Chance the Rapper], “CRZY,” and “Nights Like This” [feat. Ty Dolla $ign] and streams in the billions. Not to mention, Billboard Women In Music honored her with the “Rule Breaker Award” as she gathered nominations at the Soul Train Awards and the American Music Awards. Plus, she made show-stopping appearances at Voodoo Music + More, Coachella, and beyond. In the aftermath of 2019’s chart-topping While We Wait mixtape, everything changed. She became a mom. As such, parenthood left an indelible imprint on her second full-length, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t. Out May 8th, It Was Good Until It Wasn’t is described by Kehlani as her most mature body of work, featuring songs based on her own real experiences including recently released “Toxic” and “Everybody Business.” In the end, you’ll know exactly what’s on Kehlani’s mind, heart, and soul on It Was Good Until It Wasn’t.\n",

      "What is Roblox? ROBLOX is an online virtual playground and workshop, where kids of all ages can safely interact, create, have fun, and learn. It’s unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 13 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX — interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything — be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer “Capture the Flag” game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (“Robux”). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.\n",

      "{'Title': 'ALI SIDDIQ: RUGGED [Full Stand Up Comedy Special]', 'Description': 'Ali Siddiq is many things—a master storyteller, a comedy powerhouse—but a handyman?  Not even close. In his brand-new special, RUGGED, Ali trades the past gripping tales of his Domino Effect series (40+ million views on YouTube!) for a hilarious deep dive into his current home life, where his DIY attempts go horribly wrong.  From botched repairs and general home maintenance failures, to a family that has zero faith in his handyman skills, Ali delivers his signature blend of sharp wit and real-life storytelling. You’re going to laugh, cringe, and feel a little better about your own abilities. \\n\\nTour dates: www.AliSiddiq.com    \\nJun 20:  Raleigh           \\nJun 21: Nashville        \\nAug 1-2: BREA, CA\\nAug 8-9:   SALT LAKE CITY, UT\\nAug 15-17: West Nyack, NY \\nAug 20:   ALBANY, NY \\nAugust 22: Atlantic City, NJ\\nAugust 29 : Huntsville, AL \\nAugust 30 : Chattanooga, TN\\nAugust 31 : Greenville, SC \\nSeptember 5 : Buffalo, NY \\nSeptember 6 : Toronto, ON \\nSeptember 12 : Lexington, KY\\nSeptember 13 : St Louis, MO \\nSeptember 19 : Gulfport, MS \\nSeptember 20 : Dothan, AL \\nSeptember 26 : San Diego, CA \\nOctober 3 : Greensboro, NC \\nOctober 4 : Columbia, SC \\nOctober 10 : Wichita, KS \\nOctober 11 : Fayetteville, AR \\nOctober 17 : Louisville, KY \\nOctober 18 : Cincinnati, OH  \\nOctober 24 : Rockford, IL \\nOctober 25 : Flint, MI \\nNovember 1 : Little Rock, AR \\nNovember 7 : Omaha, NE \\nNovember 8 : Kansas City, MO \\nNovember 14 : Orlando, FL \\nNovember 15 : Tampa, FL \\nNovember 21 : Norfolk, VA \\nNovember 22 : Richmond, VA \\nNovember 28 : Dallas, TX \\nDecember 5 : Portland, OR \\nDecember 6 : Seattle, WA\\nDecember 12 : New Haven, CT\\nDecember 13 : Brooklyn, NY \\nDecember 19 : Fort Myers, FL \\nDecember 20 : Palm Beach, FL \\n\\n\\nConnect on social media!\\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/alisiddiq/?hl=en\\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/ali.siddiq.92\\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thealisiddiq\\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/ali_speaks\\n\\n#alisiddiq #standupcomedy #standup #comedy #comedian #comedyspecial #funny #trending #jokes', 'Channel Title': 'Ali Siddiq', 'Published At': '2025-06-15T21:00:07Z', 'Category ID': '23', 'View Count': '576867', 'Like Count': '44334', 'Favorite Count': '0', 'Tags': \"Comedy,Def Jam,Showtime,HBO,Comic View,Laugh,Comedy Central,Comedian Ali Siddiq,Funny,Creative,TV,stand-up,stand-up comedy,Ali Siddiq,the domino effect,somino,effect,domino effect,one hour stand up special,stand up,houston,tx,def comedy jam,nbc,bring the funny,it's bigger than these bars,the joe rogan experience,live from gotham,incarceration,ali siddiq stand up full,ali siddiq mexicans got on boots,rugged,comedy special\", 'Video ID': 'FSbE9EAHiGU', 'Region Code': 'US'}\n",
